# Title: Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description of the Project
This project is part of the MITx Full-Stack Developer Course. In this project busses in Boston are moving along the Massachussets Avenue by using real-time data from Boston MBTA API. 

## How to Run
* clone this repository 
* create an account at mapbox.com in order to create your own access token for the map
* insert the access token where indicated in the "RealTimeBusTracker.js" file
* open the "Bus_Traker.html" file in your browser

## Ideas for future improvements
* show name of busstop when hovering over the icon instead of clicking on it
* paint the track that the bus has taken
* fetch data from the bus schedule to see when the bus arrives at a busstop
